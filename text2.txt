Computers provide an invaluable tool in education, primarily in the acquisition and analysis of data used for research. Fields such as science, writing composition, mathematics and history all benefit from access to the Internet. Educational programs designed to stimulate learning provide alternative ways for students to learn a subject. 
Educational resources on the Internet can also be brought up whenever needed. Learning to use computers and software for problem solving, data manipulation and model building is also important for science and mathematical fields.
